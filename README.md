# Botta Chatbot

This repository contains code for a rule-based chatbot called Botta, which is meant to help women to get into computer science and to educate about prejudices in the field. Since the bot is targeted at a German audience, its language is German :)

## Credits
The code for this chatbot was adapted from the course ["Design a feminist chatbot"](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/designing-a-feminist-chatbot) which can be taken on the e-learning platform FutureLearn. I recommend it to everybody who is building tech products and wants to learn about technology bias and how to do your best in eliminating it during your design process.

The original code can be found on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/feminist-chatbot-template).
